	<p class="text">so i moved out recently due to unnecessary events caused by a selfish roommate. its been cool. however, i feel very alone. living 100% on my own feels... empty? i feel very isolated. its been nice having someone living with me. whether it was my parents or friends, its nice to always have someone around. its helpful to have them there to call me out if they see I'm not doing the best mentally when i can't see it myself. i loved that i usually had someone to hang out with and smiles to come home to. now i come home to an empty home. its nice that i have my own house don't get me wrong. but its always empty. its a bittersweet thing i guess. but being alone makes it easy for me to... be lazy, lay in bed for hours, not leave the house, eat a lot of junk food that i don't need, not keep things 100% organized, etc. but i guess its just a challenge. I've wanted to have my own place for years. now that i have it, i miss the company, the family. I'm just lonely. i have a couple friends, not sleepover friends unfortunately. maybe they'll become sleepover friends... time will tell i guess. i might get a cat. that'd be some unconditional love that i could use right now. i just have to talk to my landlord. i already have the paperwork. I'm putting it off though. probably because subconsciously I'm used to being sad and depressed, like i am rn, and my subconscious secretly loves being sad, so I'm not taking steps to fix it. which I'm aware of and need to change. tomorrow i will pay my electric bill and my parking ticket, and talk to my landlord already. i feel like I'm growing a lot though and this is just the next step. I'm learning to be more cautious with new people and learning how to read people which is cool. I'm also learning about myself. two years ago i wouldnt be able to recognize what I'm struggling with. id just continue to struggle convinced that its normal. but I'm learning that i can change it. I've started going hiking more which is a good step. and this blog post is helping me analyze my feelings and has been a good outlet for me, which is a good step. I think next I'm going to start yoga and try to continue on my meditation journey. the other day someone approached me with a self-realization book, that they gifted me, thats definitely a sign. especially since I've been becoming more aware of my spirit and my energy. i definitely feel like I'm beginning to reach a higher vibration in the universe. and maybe, guitar? might need you to mail it to me momma :). sometimes i find myself listening to old songs that remind me of certain people that I've lost. thats unhealthy. but i do it subconsciously and its usually not until I'm close to crying that i realize I'm self destructing. why do i continue to think of those people when i can't change the past? every other day the thoughts accumulate and i get sad all over again. its a cycle I'm having a hard time escaping. maybe i think of them so much because i haven't found a new family of my own in california. I've been here a year and my relationships have been kinda hit or miss. mostly miss. but those relationships are only teaching me to seek out better so I'm sure I'm getting closer to finding my people. but it feels like this is my time to learn to love myself. like the beginning of my mental glow up. its a new energy and I'm kinda excited. a big part of me is objecting to change. the comfort zone is a beautiful place but nothing ever grows there. i might need to paint that on my wall to keep me going. or "you're making progress, just trust the process." that one has been a good reminder that I've kept in the back of my head for the past month. was it just me, or did everyone have a hard time last month? energies must be off. but I've felt a big shift in the universe in the past few days. i believe a lot of good is coming my way. I'm excited for whats next. still getting a kitten though!;)  </p>
