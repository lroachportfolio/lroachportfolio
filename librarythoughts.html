	<p class="text">i am currently taking a break from catching up on work. i have realized today that i haven't healed from my traumas to the extent that id like. and I'm noticing the same rebellious behavior even though i have no authority figure to rebel against. instead it feels like I'm rebelling against myself. like theres multiple voices in my head i guess. one being the same annoying anxiety suffering ho who thinks everything is going to go wrong at any second. another who constantly tells me to procrastinate even though i want to take steps to succeed. and a third who's really just trying to get me on the right path. the frustrating thing is, the first two voices are much louder than my progressive, positive, love life and myself voice. I'm self destructingggg. ughhhhh. I'm aware and I'm trying to fight it. i just gotta keep listening to the third voice. because deep down i want to be the greatest, most authentic version of myself. but theres that stubborn part of me that wants to continue in my unhealthy actions and not take the steps i need to get better. which i DON'T KNOW WHYYYY???? like what could possibly be good about having a nicotine addiction, little motivation and drive to chase my passions, and a fear of vulnerability that makes it so hard to open up to people????? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! but I'm so scared to be 100% myself. i think I'm just so scared of failure that I've convinced myself, that if i don't do anything then i can't fail. which is probably why I'm struggling with school because its so much work and I'm scared of the outcomes. what if i work so hard for a degree and am still not enough for my dream job. that fucking fear of not being good enough is killing me. i know why i feel that way. I've been cheated on more times than i can count, my dad was so hard on me and belittled me so much as a kid, and I've lost so many friends that I'm afraid to let people in. its not an irrational fear, i have logical reasons to think I'm not good enough. what I'm having trouble with is changing that mindset. I'm literally getting anxiety as i type this. DON'T JUDGE ME FOR MY ISSUES, LMAO. i don't know how to unlearn that lesson. I'm really gonna start chanting mantras or something because this is really holding me back. ugh anxiety for change!!!! why do i get so anxious!!!! like my stomach is all tightened up right now. ok... breathe. does anyone have any examples of what they've done to change their way of thinking? a girl need some help lol. now I'm scared to post this cuz i don't like asking for help. UGH! doing it anyway, listening to the positive voice.  </p>
