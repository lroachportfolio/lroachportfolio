		<p class="text">i don’t love him
i never once told him i love him.
and i told hunter literally the day after our first date
there’s no way it was real love
i think my mind has been clouded by what could have been dude
and i don’t want to let go of it
subconsciously anyway
he was the main person i cared about because he told me he loved me and i was getting very little love from my dad at the time like was literally moving to get away from him and jason was the love i was hoping to have to fill that hole that’s why it hurt so bad when he pushed me away. because that was the love that i was desperate for. i was fucked up with daddy issues.not to mention they have the same name . i still hold on because i had more of a chance of receiving that love from jason rather than my dad. i mean my dad and i are what we are. we talk but about very little. it’s not what it should be.
both relationships were rough
but my dad stayed by me.
the guy who "loved" me disappeared
at least i know my dad really loves me
i also know that jason never truly did.
and if i never told him i loved him than did i really love him?
do i love him?
No.
life would have been trash had that worked out.
it’s funny because a couple years ago, i was outside smoking weed and i saw two shooting stars within like ten seconds of eachother. the first one i wished for jason. and the second one i wished for happiness. we had a good amount of time together. but it ended and now i’m getting my second wish, my journey to happiness.
I’m glad you’ve moved on. And i’m glad that i’m beginning to.  </p>
