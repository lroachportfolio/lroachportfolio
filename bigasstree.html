	<p class="text">i am feeling not great. i feel empty. my heart is unfulfilled but I'm having a hard time doing things that would make me feel anything. i had a lot of free time today and i spent most of it watching netflix. i just feel stuck. I'm not happy with my work situation, but I'm not taking steps to find a new job that makes me happier. i feel paralyzed with physically progressing. theres so many things that i would love to do but i have little motivation to even begin. and then when i do begin i get overwhelmed and quit a few minutes in. i can't figure out why I'm feeling so... i don't even have the right word for how i feel. just very blah i guess. i don't know. i miss the people from colorado. we might not have all been at our healthiest mentally but they were family. and LA is great don't get me wrong, but I'm having a hard time finding people i can have real deep conversations with. I'm having a hard time connecting to others, and to myself, and to the world in general. i need to find my purpose because right now I'm drowning in boredom and a lack of motivation. how do i get over the belief that I'm not good enough? its crippling me. i need closure. from those that witnessed my episode and my dad. but i don't know how to start those conversations. I'm really struggling with my demons. writing really really helps though. just the feeling of typing all this out alone is uplifting. i want nothing more than to feel at ease and peaceful and one with myself. this bipolar shit is really unnecessary. feeling great one day and a week later feeling stuck. i know i keep using that word but i just feel like I'm driving down a road and theres a fallen tree in my path and i can't get around it or turn around. i mean theres nothing to turn around to. the people in my past are gone. they want nothing to do with me. my life was toxic and i was unhealthy, i can't go back to that. but how do i get around this tree? ill have to make my own path. and my car won't fit. so i have to leave that behind as well. ok so leave behind the baggage. leave behind the pain and false truths that I've been taught to believe all my life. but I'm so attached to it... I'm not good with change and I'm not good with letting go. and thats okay. but i have to figure out how to or I'm just gonna be stuck looking at this huge ass tree in my path, overwhelmed and scared. I'm so overwhelmed. maybe i can jump over it. take a leap of faith and just let go. f thats scary. I'm scared to go back and I'm scared to go forward. but going forward is better than backwards right? i need to just close my eyes and make this jump into the next chapter of my life and finally let everything go. but how? how do i let go? I've been shown to bottle everything up and push it so far down inside of me. that way i don't show emotion and i don't show weakness.  but thats not healthy either. I'm scared to let it all out. I'm scared to cry and feel all the pain that I've been suppressing. i don't know what to expect. and that scares me. damn I'm a fucking pussy lmao. its time to take this leap of faith or ill be stuck here forever.  </p>
