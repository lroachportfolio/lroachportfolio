		<p class="text">listening to LA Capone with homies. home girl been talking me through a lot lately. i think I'm starting to understand some things. I've learned i gotta watch how naive i can be. i let a lot of people take advantage of me. home girl don't take no shit from anybody. I'm a dirty door mat letting people walk all over me. i get it, that needs to change. but how do i change it effectively? is there a rulebook of what you should expect from people and whats not okay? I've let people use me most my life, I'm not sure where to start. maybe stop giving rides to people who just need a ride and don't want to hang. its weird tho.
     I've always been taught to be nice and i guess i always try to be there for people. but now I'm being told to be more reserved and cautious. which i get. and I'm surprised i haven't adopted that already cuz like i said a lot of people have used me. maybe deep down i don't mind it? thats fucked. i "don't mind" being used. what the fuck typa state of mind is that? do i not value myself? why? interesting...
    lemme process that... ok, I'm an amazing ass person. I'm strong, I'm independent, I'm loyal, I'm smart, I'm caring, maybe too nice. I deserve more than i get. I do a lot for people. more than i should. buying things for people and never getting paid back. giving out rides whenever for people that don't even spend time with me on the weekly. i am too nice. i give so much and i get very little in return. a new motto courtesy of home girl, "don't make yourself available". okay, imma work on that. </p>
