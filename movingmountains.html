	<p class="text">today I'm feeling lighter. i was able to get a new bank account and hopefully survive this whole financial issue I've been forced to face. I've been thinking about life. I've realized how beautiful of a concept it is, to be alive. its simulation like. all outcomes based on cause and effect. i feel like that as long as you have positive intentions you will get positive results. not always going to be true, but a wholesome statement to base beliefs off of. summer semester is almost over. i have fantastic grades. design has me stuck a little bit. or maybe I've just been having a hard time being creative. but its something i can work on which is a positive. my class was just given free mounting boards so ill do some oil pastel work after i finish my project. i really want to be the best me i can be, and I'm getting closer everyday. i need to keep focusing on my grind. its kinda hard to do because results are slow to take shape. but I'm growing stronger as a person and as an artist. my mom is coming to visit next month and i couldn't be more excited. we have a yoga relaxation retreat planned! its going to be transformational. I'm really going to start focusing on me. I'm not going to allow myself to get caught up in the day to day stresses anymore. I'm going to start working harder and stop procrastinating because its hurting my mental health. as for my last post, I'm choosing to move on. there is no point to wallow in self pity. i made mistakes, but they're in the past. and since theres nothing i can do to change it, theres no point to think about it constantly. i hope i stick with this and that my mind allows my heart to let go. it'd really be a boost for my mental health. I've really been thinking about the future and what i want to do with my life. i have a lot of ideas when it comes to humanitarian work. as far as career goes I'm not really sure what i want. if it were up to me, id be traveling the world in a volkswagen bus, mala beads around my neck, and in a completely zen state. id really like to be able to backpack the world after college. I'm gonna need a better job to be able to afford it. i think I'm finally ready to take the next step in my career. I'm going to apply to new jobs today. listening to the positive voice is really helping me. </p>
