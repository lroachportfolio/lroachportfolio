	<p class="text">its been a while since ive been on here. im doing great. things are really getting better. I got promoted to a busser and im making a lot more money already. the biggest thing that happened, happened yesterday. I confronted my dad. I told him how all his insults made me feel growing up and how a lot of it affected the way I view myself. I told him the toll its taken on my self confidence and that he is the biggest reason I don't think im good enough. and guess what?? he actually apologized and it wasn't halfass! he actually meant it and that means the world to me. I am so proud of myself for finding my voice and finding the courage to have that conversation with him. I feel liberated. I can finally heal and move on from all the bullshit. my apartment is really coming together. I got a new desk and chair and my parents got me my dream computer!!! I worked so freaking hard for it. and im grateful that they made the deal with me because it pushed me to actually invest myself in school. and now that I started getting a's again, I remember how much I love the feeling of succeeding and how im capable of it. im definitely going to continue to push myself to be great because its an amazing feeling. therapy recently was great too. ive finally stopped my mood from doing backflips and now I can focus on mindfulness practices and start looking to things outside of myself, start working towards my goals. stable mind and a stable environment are key. it is now time to let my soul take over and I couldn't be happier. my mom gets here on Saturday. im so excited to see her and for her to see my progress. shes been with me through all my phases and I hope I make her proud. things are so good. I paid rent on time for the second month which im happy about because, paying bills on time causes me LOTS of anxiety. but im doing it. not only that but im keeping my apartment clean. its a surprise because growing up my room was always a disaster. ive made friends with a coworker! shes older than me but we relate on so many levels. we were talking about how its hard to not spend money on weed, but when we don't we get to buy other things like, new drapes lol or new pots and pans. its weird how growing up you get excited about new things. like buying a doormat. I never thought that kind of purchase would make me smile so much haha. this adulting thing isn't as hard as I thought and im actually proud of myself. </p>
